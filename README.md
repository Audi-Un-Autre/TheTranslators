# TheTranslators

Do you like Discord bots ?
Do they cheer you up when they talk to you ?
When they obey your every command ?
WHEN THEY PLAY MUSIC FOR YOU ?

ahem.

Well, introducing magical Monsieur and superb Seonsaengnim ! The French and Korean bots.
These two take Google's Translation API and translate words! Yes ... words like people, place, and things. And sentences. That, too.

# Inspiration

I love French. The language. The contemporary pop. The food. Ever since I can remember French is the one language I've always wanted to learn to speak fluently. It's a work in progress. I mean isn't all language a work in progress ^^;
Ah, but Korean is a different story. I have a friend who loves KDrama and why not help her out with a handy dandy bot that can translate the odd word here and there when she's watching her favourite kdrama.

So then, why not make a bots that can help our language needs ?

# But wait, is there more ?

Monsieur and Seonsaengnim are for the most part all grown up. But, this isn't the end. DeepL is on the horizon and offers quite an intriguing API to explore. Soon, these two will go on a little adventure into the bountiful language lands of DeepL - Developer Act II !
